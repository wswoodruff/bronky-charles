                Oh noooooo what's he gonna do with thaaaaaaat????
            </p>
            <p>
                1) Don't worry this is just a joke site â€” Bronky's not gonna do anything with your ip, besides compile a map of locations from where he's been â€” so no worries!
            </p>
            <p>
                1) Including rave reviews! Here's a convo w/ me and my Dad â€”
                    Me: Did you click the button to stop the farts?
                    Dad: Actually for me that's what started them. ðŸ¤ª
                    (Me, Thinking): Aw man, this is why the internet must exist. I love it.
            </p>
            <div class='hide-it'>
                <p>
                    2) Oh yeah? Well that's exactly what any other hacker would say!
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Ehhh don't worry about it it's just Bronky, what's he gonna do???
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Why would anyone EVER DO THIS?!?!?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Listen everybody's different. This is my humor u gotta chill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) And let me tell you something else. This man is a FAMILY MAN!! He has a brother have you met him? https://bronkycharles.com and https://bronkoniouscharleston.com have been together since the VERY BEGINNING!!! Don't you EVER question their loyalty and love for eachother! Again, respectfully, thank you for understanding. Please enjoy Bronky and Bronkonious responsibly!!!
