                Uhh ohhhh! Ohhh nooooo Bronky's got ur ippppp!!
                Oh noooooo what's he gonna do with thaaaaaaat????
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) Don't worry this is just a joke site â€” Bronky's not gonna do anything with your ip, besides compile an anonymized map of locations from where he's been â€” so no worries!
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) Including rave reviews! Here's a convo w/ me and my Dad â€”
                    Me: Did you click the button to stop the farts?
                    Dad: Actually for me that's what started them. ðŸ¤ª
                    (Me, Thinking): Aw man, this is why the internet must exist. I love it.
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) This is also a PSA that every site you visit definitely has access to your IP â€” whether they know they do or not, what they wish to do with it is up to them. I don't condone abuse of user info â€” showing your IP is just part of the joke. Someone else having your IP is not serious unless many variables line up, including the person holding your ip being a scumbag, which I'm not! So chances are you're good!
            </p>

            <p>
                (human) Oh yeah? Well that's exactly what any other hacker would say!
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) Ehhh don't worry about it it's just Bronky, what's he gonna do???
            </p>
            <p>
                (human) Why would anyone EVER DO THIS?!?!?!
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) Listen everybody's different. This is my humor u gotta chill.
            </p>
            <p>
                (coder) And let me tell you something else. This man is a FAMILY MAN!!
